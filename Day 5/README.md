# Human Activity Recognition (HAR) üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüì±  
A machine learning project that classifies human activities using smartphone sensor data.  
It uses **Random Forest Classifier** from Scikit-learn with feature importance analysis and performance visualization.  



## Features  
- Classifies activities such as **Walking, Sitting, Standing, Laying, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs**  
- Uses **Random Forest** for robust and accurate classification  
- Evaluates the model using **accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score**  
- Provides a **detailed classification report** for per-class metrics  
- Visualizes performance with Confusion Matrix heatmap and Feature Importance bar chart  



## Dataset  
- Dataset used: `HAR.csv` (preprocessed Human Activity Recognition dataset)  
- Features: multiple smartphone accelerometer and gyroscope measurements  
- Target column: `Activity` (categorical labels for human actions)  



## Model Evaluation Metrics  
- **Accuracy** ‚Üí ratio of correct predictions to total predictions  
- **Precision** ‚Üí proportion of correctly predicted samples for each activity  
- **Recall** ‚Üí proportion of actual activities correctly classified  
- **F1 Score** ‚Üí harmonic mean of precision and recall  
- **Confusion Matrix** ‚Üí visual representation of classification performance across all activity classes  



## Results  
***Example run produced the following results:***  
```
Accuracy: 97.96%
Precision: 97.97%
Recall: 97.96%
F1 Score: 97.96%

## How It Works  
1. Load and preprocess the dataset (`HAR.csv`)  
2. Split data into **train (80%)** and **test (20%)** sets  
3. Train a **Random Forest Classifier** with 200 trees  
4. Predict activities on the test set  
5. Evaluate using multiple metrics  
6. Visualize results with Confusion Matrix heatmap and Feature Importance bar chart  

## Outcome  
- Achieved **~98% accuracy** on test data  
- Reliable classification across **6 human activities**  
- Feature importance plot highlights most influential signals  
- Provides a reusable and extendable ML pipeline for HAR tasks  

## Future Improvements  
- Add cross-validation to further validate performance  
- Compare Random Forest with **other classifiers** (SVM, XGBoost, Neural Networks)  
- Apply dimensionality reduction (PCA) for faster training  
- Deploy as a **real-time activity recognition app** on mobile devices
